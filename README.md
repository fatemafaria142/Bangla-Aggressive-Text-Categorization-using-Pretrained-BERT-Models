# Bangla Aggressive Text Categorization using Pretrained BERT Models

This repository contains code and resources for categorizing aggressive Bangla text using various pretrained BERT models like mBERT, BanglaBert, and Bangla bert base.

## Introduction

The project aims to classify aggressive text in the Bangla language leveraging the power of pretrained BERT models. The repository provides scripts and notebooks to fine-tune and evaluate these models on the aggressive text classification task.
